# CentOS 6, 7 & 8 server installation and configuration

Please, **download _all files_ before executing any script**. There are several dependencies between them. You can use:
```bash
sudo yum install wget unzip -y
wget https://github.com/simplyjarod/server/archive/master.zip
unzip master.zip && cd server-master && rm -rf ../master.zip
chmod u+x *.sh -R
```

## LAMP server: Linux + apache + MySQL + php
Run `./lamp-install.sh` as **root** from the folder this file is placed.

This script will execute:

4. php installation (and some "basic" libraries and modules)
